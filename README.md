# sub-bot
A in theory should work sub bot for youtube.

#How it works

It generates random protonmail accounts(for some reason selenium can't detect some elements)
The sub-bot is currently set to subscribe to Night Owl Cinematics. Change the link from https://www.youtube.com/user/Alozerk?sub_confirmation=1 to your youtube subscribe link
